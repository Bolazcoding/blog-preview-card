## My process

- I imported a google font family for the card texts
- I created different container and classes for each content to make it easier to design using css
- Used \*- universal selector for all html element setting margin, padding to zero and box-sizing to border-box.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I tested my CSS skills, using box model, media queries and flexbox.

### Continued development

This project tested my skills but I'm looking forward to more projects to build in the future.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://fonts.google.com/) - This helped me for my font family in this project. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
